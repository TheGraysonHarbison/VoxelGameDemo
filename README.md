# VoxelGameDemo
 This is an implementation of Voxel-Based Procedural Terrain Generation similar to video games such as Minecraft all inside the Unity Game Engine.

 This tech demo utilizes techniques such as Multi-Threading and Greedy Meshing in order to reduce computation time and stored memory.	

 NOTICE. This project includes FastNoiseLite as a perlin noise algorithm.
